# burger
The burger app SHOULD be working but it continues to throw me an error relentlessly about the burger.all function in the burgers_controllers.js file. I am frustrated in the debugging process and need a good night's rest before I can dive deeper into discovering the issue.

Other than the above issue, the code here should create a fully functioning Bugers application.  It should allow you to create and devour burgers at your leisure using the handlebars and express node frameworks. Enjoy da burgers.
